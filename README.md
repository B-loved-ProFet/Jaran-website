## I didn't know anything aboud webdev before starting this project. My gf's mom asked me if i could make website for her, i said that i could, so i learned how to do it and here it is.

---

I realize now that this repo is kind of a mess however i learned a lot from this and if i was ever to make another website/app i'd know much more about how to do things more properly

## Project Structure

`.astro` files are in the `src/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
